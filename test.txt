0	it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .
0	with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
0	grating and tedious .
0	my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
0	to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
0	expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies .
0	nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .
0	philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
0	less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
0	there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .
0	though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliche .
0	i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief .
0	to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .
0	it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
0	really dumb but occasionally really funny .
0	the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
0	nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
0	how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .
0	despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
0	analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
0	shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
0	becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't .
0	a chiller resolutely without chills .
0	while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .
0	as vulgar as it is banal .
0	elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .
0	the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
0	flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .
0	the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
0	denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
0	after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .
0	'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
0	the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters .
0	an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .
0	when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
0	more maudlin than sharp .
0	if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick .
0	ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .
0	an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
0	watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
0	there is so much plodding sensitivity .
0	it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
0	a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
0	if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
0	gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable .
0	a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .
0	two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
0	in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
0	oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
0	it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire .
0	the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
0	with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
0	it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up .
0	if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil .
0	i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art .
0	to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw .
0	less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .
0	too close to phantom menace for comfort .
0	it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .
0	a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either .
0	secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
0	nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
0	it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary .
0	there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through .
0	time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .
0	weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes .
0	an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson .
0	the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
0	there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .
0	the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way .
0	the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
0	romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .
0	one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .
0	parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core .
0	one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
0	carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
0	a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .
0	a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .
0	it's all surface psychodramatics .
0	there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
0	fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot !
0	aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
0	the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) .
0	more of a career curio than a major work .
0	while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house .
0	it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
0	hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .
0	wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
0	as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .
0	cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
0	jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
0	hollywood's answer to an air ball .
0	completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
0	. . . really horrible drek .
0	while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production .
0	in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
0	it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons  a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
0	you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
0	[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .
0	apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other .
0	while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire .
0	when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean .
0	few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance .
0	a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .
0	the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
0	the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
0	a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship .
0	she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . .
0	the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one .
0	even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea .
0	the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
0	the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .
0	every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol .
0	the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .
0	it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
0	despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
0	when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .
0	[evans is] a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .
0	deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered .
0	the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project .
0	there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
0	a major waste . . . generic .
0	has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . .
0	this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
0	it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film .
0	now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud .
0	the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
0	when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
0	the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows .
0	everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .
0	basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars .
0	little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
0	just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
0	a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
0	tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool .
0	as saccharine as it is disposable .
0	showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro .
0	all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast .
0	it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
0	starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .
0	it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah .
0	aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
0	involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
0	it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
0	highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .
0	rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .
0	aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .
0	this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
0	a dreary movie .
0	a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
0	it's just a little too self-satisfied .
0	chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
0	diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .
0	. . . overly melodramatic . . .
0	all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin .
0	what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
0	despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
0	oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .
0	. . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .
0	the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
0	despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .
0	the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
0	the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes .
0	a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .
0	theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .
0	schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad .
0	i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't .
0	tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination .
0	. . . a pretentious mess . . .
0	the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .
0	i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
0	lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .
0	the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
0	if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday .
0	no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
0	[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .
0	the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
0	'this movie sucks . '
0	its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
0	this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
0	anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
0	its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) .
0	a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .
0	it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't .
0	this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often .
0	strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short .
0	where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .
0	what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
0	despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore .
0	it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
0	adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all .
0	the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .

0	in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle .
0	press the delete key .
0	it's an awfully derivative story .
0	lacks depth .
0	you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
0	even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
0	the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
0	the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
0	its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
0	it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it .
0	build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .
0	seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago .
0	though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .
0	the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
0	shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
0	conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences .
0	if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
0	if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) .
0	one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .
0	strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .
0	one groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
0	the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys .
0	feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .
0	this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .
0	enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid .
0	as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising .
0	it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making .
0	don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .
0	with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie cliches .
0	perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .
0	once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny .
0	sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .
0	the story itself is actually quite vapid .
0	ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin .
0	at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford .
0	with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .
0	this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september .
0	anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .
0	the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
0	large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better .
0	unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
0	jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
0	if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
0	even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort .
0	as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
0	mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .
0	a processed comedy chop suey .
0	the film's essentially over by the meet-cute .
0	if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan .
0	it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .
0	the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
0	this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them !
0	in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
0	new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is .
0	just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .
0	adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild .
0	this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .
0	as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear .
0	scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle .
0	the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid .
0	this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .
0	it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .
0	glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .
0	during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' .
0	no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .

0	es triste tener que decirles que lo unico grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . .
0	hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't .
0	in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
0	as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
0	every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
0	enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .
0	despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire .
0	" i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
0	routine and rather silly .
0	an intriguing near-miss .

0	some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
0	the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
0	some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one .
0	the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
0	collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
0	broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .

0	the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance .
0	you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
0	director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
0	ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism .
0	the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .

0	though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
0	so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style .
0	ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .

0	to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .
0	sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
0	merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense .
0	while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances .
0	. . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats .
0	it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill

0	you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story .
0	boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
0	the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .

0	doesn't add up to much .
0	as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
0	the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood .
0	cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time .
0	so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .
0	makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .

0	no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
0	the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .

0	a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
0	this is so bad .

0	it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
0	this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
0	it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned .
0	if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
0	master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .

0	be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .
0	it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
0	staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .
0	the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .
0	another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .
0	a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
0	everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .
0	after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
0	often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? into how long is this movie ?

0	kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
0	they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
0	the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
0	in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
